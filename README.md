**Virtual Robot Mania**: https://github.com/zevbo/VirtualRobotMania

During the summer aftrer high school senior year, the lack of robotics and socialization was really hitting me. So, I decided to knock out two birds with one stones. I took a couple weeks, and cobbled together a small scale car-like robot simulator in Scheme that was so easy for even beginners to code. I organized a competitions centering around it for my extended family, and it was a lot of fun.

I then re-wrote it with a closer focus on making it sustainable for multiple competitions. I changed programming languages to OCaml, I created an original 2d physics engine from scratch, and designed a standard system to make new competitions. If you're interested specifically in my physics engine, it can be found in this directory: https://github.com/zevbo/VirtualRobotMania/tree/master/ocaml/virtuality2d/src. The section of the simulator I am most proud of is how I deal with collisions, the code for which can be found here: https://github.com/zevbo/VirtualRobotMania/blob/master/ocaml/virtuality2d/src/body.ml#L709. 

**Highschool Robotics**: https://github.com/SciBorgs/InfiniteRecharge-2020 and https://github.com/SciBorgs/DeepSpace-2019

Junior and Senior year of high school I put a lot of effort into my robotics team. On the DeepSpace-2019 repository, I wrote a lot of valuable automation which I was proud of, but I hadn't yet learned how to actually design code architechture, and as a result it's not designed praticularly inutively. However in 2020, where I wrote less of the automation, I put a lot of effort into creating a powerful and intuitive architechture for the rest of the team to use. 

If you're interested, go to https://github.com/SciBorgs/InfiniteRecharge-2020 and follow the READMEs. They're short and straight to the point :)

**Small Projects**: 

Honestly, sometimes all I want to do is write a short program to play a game or something, which I will generally write in Racket. A couple of fun examples are a connect 4 game with adjustable size (https://github.com/zevbo/Random-Racket-Stuff/blob/master/Adjustable%20Connect%204.rkt), a sudoko solver (https://github.com/zevbo/Random-Racket-Stuff/blob/master/sudokuSolver.rkt), and a program to show how images transform moving at relativistic speeds (https://github.com/zevbo/Java-Stuffs/blob/master/Modern%20Shapes/ModernShapes.java).
