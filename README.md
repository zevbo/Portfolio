During the summer aftrer high school senior year, the lack of robotics and socialization was really hitting me. So, I decided to knock out two birds with one stones. I took a couple weeks, and cobbled together a small scale car-like robot simulator in Scheme that was so easy for even beginners to code. I organized a few competitions centering around it for my extended family, and it was a ton of fun.

I'm currently re-writing the back-end in OCaml, to make it sustainable. Plus, I was kind of over-writing more than a thousand lines in an untyped language.

Junior and Senior year of high school I put a lot of effort into my robotics team. On the DeepSpace-2019 repository, I wrote a lot of valuable automation which I was proud of, but I hadn't yet learned how to actually design code architechture, and as a result it's not designed praticularly inutively. However in 2020, where I wrote less of the automation, I put a lot of effort into creating a powerful and intuitive architechture for the rest of the team to use.
